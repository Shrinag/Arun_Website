            <h3>What I am now!</h3>

            <p>
                Currently, I am a PhD student in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the Indian Institute of Science, currently working on Urban Climate Modelling. I have a strong desire to learn and teach and make valuable educational content available to people.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Motivation behind the Website</h3>

            <p>
                The reasons why I started this website is four fold.
            </p>

            <p>
                First off, being an active reader, I used to find lots of information, articles, blogs, videos on various topics in Mathematics, Science, Software, Programming, and OS. Sadly, there is only so much you can remember. After this realization in my Master's Degree, I made it a point to make a note of them and curate the notes in an organized fashion. After several attempts using various software, Web-based notes turned out to be the most effective option for me for self-reference and for referring it to other people.
            </p>

            <p>
                Second, ever since I started my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUJFj-PXuWLRfFFHA44ZGYw">YouTube</a> Channel back in April 2015, I posted quite a lot of tutorials on Programming and always planned to have a website to back it up with supplementary notes and walk-through. I have some plans to expand the channel to many different topics in physics and calculus aiming at high-school students, graduate students, and beyond. So, I felt this will help in the channel's publicity as well as providing valuable supporting content for my channel.
            </p>

            <p>
                Third, It was my desire to have a personal website for a long time. Occasionally, I tried to attempt and explore my artistic sides (blogging, character analysis in books, series, poetry, photography, some science experiments) and thus I wanted a place to publish them and share them with full freedom. Having a website became a great opportunity to embark on these areas.
            </p>

            <p>
                And finally, I wanted a place to show about my research interests, CV, academic and personal accomplishments for professional purposes.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was going back and forth on this idea for since 2014 when all of it clicked on 2017 after my second year anniversary of my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUJFj-PXuWLRfFFHA44ZGYw">YouTube</a> channel. After getting some confidence in making simple webpages, learning from various sources, looking for technologies to fulfill all my requirements, getting advices from fellow friends and colleagues who already have websites to fill in for the knowledge gaps, I decided to go ahead with the idea. With the help of my friend Nagashri Krishnamurthy, I got the website made and the rest is yet to unfold!
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>What to Expect?</h3>
            <p>
                The major motivation for my website is for the notes. With time, this website will be flooded with walk-throughs and summary notes for programming, software, operating systems etc., Not only that, with time, I (hopefully) plan to release notes for topics in Mathematics, Physics, with accompanied supplements which could be programming scripts, javascript based applications etc., Based on the ideas I get, I might even add other articles that might interest many readers.
            </p>

            <p>
                As things stand, I just have a vision and I hope to deliver them the best I could.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the abouts page, you can get to know more about me, with my educational and technical background. For those who are curious and want to know more, there is a separate section called "Hacker Section" where you can get to know about my other interests in greater detail. This would be more "nerdy, and geeky" if you will.
            </p>

            <p>
                The blogs page is where I post most of my artisitic ideas and shout my ideas to the world. Most of them would be re-directs to my contents in <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Arun-Prasaad-Gunasekaran">Quora</a> (I love the website, and I have written 800+ answers. So, I do not want to delete it), but my recent entries would be posted here, (and a copy in my <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Arun-Prasaad-Gunasekaran">Quora</a> account.) If at all I become charged with ideas, I will blog it here!
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Do support my work!</h3>
            <p>
                Your support means a lot to me!
            </p>

            <p>
                As of now, this website is being hosted using the revenue obtained by my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUJFj-PXuWLRfFFHA44ZGYw">YouTube</a> channel using ads. While that is enough for me to run this channel, I would be very grateful if you are my subscriber, or a frequent visitor to my channel and spread the word about my work to your friends, colleagues, family, students, basically anyone who could benefit from the contents I post.
            </p>

            <p>
                I would be more happy if you could contribute to my channel, and my work in a more direct way. This includes any constructive ideas to improve my videos, suggestions for notes, new ideas and topics that I could try and embark on, pointing out typos, flaws or outdated content etc.,

            </p>

            <p>
                Basically, if you provide any means to improve the quality of my work, I would be happy!
            </p>

            <p>
                That being said, some of you readers and subscribers have suggested me to have a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/"> Patreon</a> account. I am deeply considering the possibility of it and exploring other options out there!
            </p>
